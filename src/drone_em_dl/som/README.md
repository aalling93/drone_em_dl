# self organising maps

is a type of unsupervised learning for anomaly detection using one layer of neurons. 

SOMs is reducing the features (like, e.g., PCA, MNF or AE) and detect the features. It can also be used directl to visualuse the data (like T-SNE). So, it is a pretty smart method to do ans show dimensionality reduction. It is not used much outside of acedemia, 

SOM represents the input data in a 2D space (x,y array like). Except anomaly detection, it is used for data mining, face recognition, pattern recognition, speech analysis, etc. etc.

SOM preserves the spatial relationsship between the features of input and ouput. (topology.) But, most DL does this....
